# Book Perception

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a solution for all the book lovers out there and make them have a whole new experience too. The apps that are already available in the market just either help them to look for good reads or are generic habit trackers. Our app combines the two and makes it a complete solution for everyone. It enables them to inculcate the brilliant habit of reading and looking up their favourite books and make their custom reads.

The project is majorly divided into 3 sections:

- Authentication
- Habit Tracker
- Search
- ChatRoom
